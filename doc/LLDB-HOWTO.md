## How to debug your native extension

You must start by building your native extension in debug mode

    neon build --debug

Then start node using rust-lldb

    rust-lldb node

Inside lldb you need to pass your node command line arguments after --

    process launch -- -e 'require("./")'

To setup breakpoints you can use the regexp breakpoint command

    br s -r <your-library>::<your-function>

where <your-library> is  the value of package.name in your Cargo.toml file.

Print variables with

    p <your-var-name>


## OS X specific

In order to be able to print variable information on OS X
you must have XCode 8.0 or better installed, see the following
